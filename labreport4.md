# Lab Report 4
## Task Competition
### Here are the steps to follow in order to complete the task after starting the timer (steps 4-9):
**Step 4: *Logging Into ieng6***

- [ ] `ssh cse15lwi23atv@ieng6.ucsd.edu <enter>`

Here I am typing this command to log into the ieng6 account via ssh, and I do not need to provide a password as logging in is being handled by pre-generated ssh keys.

**Step 5: *Clonging the forked repository***

- [ ] `git clone <^v><enter>`
- [ ] `cd l<tab><enter>`

In order to clone the repository I am using the ssh clone link on github, so that I will not need to provide a password for authentication when I want to push commits to the repository later. The authentication here is also being handled by generated ssh keys. I paste the repository link using ctrl-v. Then, I cd into the cloned repository by pressing tab in order to autocomplete `l` into `lab/7`.

**Step 6: *Running JUnit Tests***
